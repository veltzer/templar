in python you have two major contenders for packaging: distutils and setuptools.

- distutils comes with python and setuptools in an external module.
- setuptools is much more feature rich.
- I went with setuptools.
- I also need the git plugin to setuptools since setuptools knows
	how to query git to get the list of files which are under source control.
