- make templar import all modules in templar/
	this means that all the project can drop their templar_cmd.py script and templar
	can supply that script.
- add mako as requirement for this package.
- when chmodding an output file in templar just removed the write, don't change all the permissions.
- make the script create the folders of the output files (the makefile no longer does this).
- add an example .details.ini file to the package so that people will know how to write this.
- make this package use itself to ease mgmt.
