- do system for uploading to more than one series in my ppa.
- make the changelog better - do a script that makes the changelog
	and have the changelog be a git log for debian.
- make sure that when we build debian packages (source or binary)
	the log of the debuild(1) tool does not show any warnings and/or errors.
	We already cleaned out the errors, now there are only warning from
	the debuild tool and lintian.
- why do we remove passwords when doing "makeprint".
	the reason is that we don't want passwords written to the .tdefs.config
	file.
	But we can have make(1) read the data from templar without saving it to file.
		that would actually be better because then no file would need to be created
		or changed.
	how do we do that?
	- one option is to create a fifo and have make read from that.
	- do we really need make to read from the file? maybe all make laws should
	be python processes and they can read the parameters directly from the py module?

- make templar import all modules in templar/
	this means that all the project can drop their templar_cmd script and templar
	can supply that script.
- add mako as requirement for this package.
- when chmodding an output file in templar just removed the write, don't change all the permissions.
- add an example .details.ini file to the package so that people will know how to write this.
