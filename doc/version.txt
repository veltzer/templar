the current version is the current git tag (possible with '~series'
appended to it for ppa/launchpad/ubuntu purposes).

from git it is distributed to other places:
- debian/changelog - which is very important since debian package
	building takes the version from there
- setup.py - I don't really know if the version there is important
	but it is correct and taken dynamically from git non-the-less.
